   **Default Command:**
   - The initial command selected by default is the **shell command**.

### JSON Structure
The structure of the menu items is represented as a JSON array of objects:
```
[
    {"name": "‚≠ê whisper", "value": "command to execute"},
    {"name": "‚≠ê Open Interpreter", "value": "interpreter -i"},
    {"name": "üî¥ SearXNG Open Search", "value": "firefox 127.0.0.1:8081/"},
    {"name": "üî¥ Windmill Codeless webhooks", "value": "firefox 127.0.0.1"},
    {"name": "üß° DO-0-IP", "value": "ssh root@127.0.0.1 -i ~/.ssh/pk"},
    {"name": "üß° sshr", "value": "ssh -l 127.0.0.1"},
    {"name": "‚ú® fabric", "value": "~/fabric/fabric "},
    {"name": "‚ú® fabric_extract_youtube", "value": "fb --stream --pattern extract_wisdom -y "},
    {"name": "üíö nano_bashrc", "value": "nano ~/.bashrc"},
    {"name": "üíö source_bashrc", "value": "source ~/.bashrc"},
    {"name": "....."}
]
```
Each object contains the following fields:
- `name`: Represents the display name of the command, often including an emoticon.
- `value`: Represents the CLI command to be executed when selected.

Additionally, columns in the menu are divided based on the emoticon at the start of the data items.

## Functionality Overview
- **get_input()**: Captures user keyboard input for menu navigation, supporting arrow keys and enter key for selection.
- **execute_command(command_value)**: Executes the command associated with the selected menu item using the `subprocess` module.
- **exit_application()**: Gracefully exits the application.
- **main()**: Coordinates the application's flow, handling input and rendering the menu.
- **load_commands()**: (Assumed) Loads command data for the menu.
- **group_commands(commands)**: (Assumed) Groups commands into columns based on some criteria.
- **render_menu(columns, selected_row, selected_col)**: Displays the command menu in a structured format, highlighting the selected item.

## Known Issues
- **Blinking** occurs when an arrow key is pressed.
- Pressing **Enter** does not exit the menu cleanly.
- The CLI command does not always execute successfully.
- After running the CLI command, the application may be called multiple times due to the menu receiving background keyboard input.
